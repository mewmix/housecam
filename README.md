**Mr. House CRT Effect Shaders**

## OBS Filters
Add these as a **User-Defined Shader** source filter in OBS.

**Tip:** For best results, use **Background Removal / Live Portrait** (specifically the "Lite" model) in OBS *before* applying these shaders to isolate the subject on a black background.


*   **`mrhouse_crt_portrait.effect`**: Portrait-oriented green-phosphor CRT with fisheye lens and solid black borders.
*   **`mrhouse_crt_cinematic.effect`**: **Movie/Cinematic Tone**. Olive/yellow-green hue, low saturation, dirty bloom, and brown-green background. Designed for mood and age.
*   **`mrhouse_crt_game.effect`**: **Game Version Tone**. Pale mint green, cleaner visuals, moderate saturation, and near-black background. Designed for readability.
*   **`fallout_terminal.effect`**: Standard Fallout P1 Green Phosphor Terminal.
*   **`fallout_terminal_cinematic.effect`**: **Movie/Cinematic Terminal**. Olive tones, dirty bloom, aged look.
*   **`fallout_terminal_game.effect`**: **Game Version Terminal**. Mint green, clean bloom, high readability.
