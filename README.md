**Mr. House CRT Effect Shaders**

## OBS Filters
Add these as a **User-Defined Shader** source filter in OBS.

*   **`mrhouse_crt_fisheye.effect`**: Standard green-phosphor CRT with fisheye lens and solid black borders.
*   **`mrhouse_crt_mask.effect`**: Same as above but with a **Spotlight Mask** (centers on you, black background), **Signal Shimmer**, and random **Glitch/V-Hold** artifacts.

## Web Version
The `index.html` file is a WebGL port of the effect.
